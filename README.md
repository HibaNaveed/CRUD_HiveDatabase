# CRUD_Hive_Database

### Introduction
This Flutter app demonstrates how to use Hive, a lightweight, fast key-value database, to manage local storage on mobile devices. In this app, you can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data such as username, email, and a date.

The primary purpose of this project is to showcase how to implement persistent storage in Flutter using Hive, making it an ideal starting point for learning how to store data locally in Flutter apps. The app features a simple user interface with Material Design components, making it easy to interact with the database and manage user information.

### Features
**Create**: Add new user data to the Hive database by providing a username, email, and date.
**Read**: Display all user data stored in the Hive database in a list view.
**Update**: Edit existing user data, including username, email, and date.
**Delete**: Remove user data from the Hive database.
**Date Picker**: Select a date from a date picker dialog, which is stored with the user data.

### Tech Stack
**Dart**: The programming language used by Flutter for building apps.
**Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
**Hive**: A lightweight and fast key-value database for Flutter that supports storing data in a local database on the device.
**Hive Flutter**: A Flutter plugin that provides integration between Flutter and the Hive database.
**Material Design**: A design language used to create a consistent and intuitive user interface.
